Hi!

I'm Luna, and you found my profile, congratulations! For now, I just want to host an github.io page ([https://0yqc.github.io/](https://0yqc.github.io/)) to showcase some of my projects and host some of my other rpogramming projects, such as my (π art generator)[https://github.com/0yqc/pi_art/].

[^1]: This is a LEGO® Website (mainly) for sharing Custom Designs (MOC: My Own Creation), [check them out!](https://rebrickable.com/)
